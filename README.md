# Design Pattern Tutorial

_An anti-pattern driven design pattern guide, for practical and structural understanding._

This is an open-source tutorial site built with [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io), focusing on **real-world design patterns**.

Rather than starting from abstract concepts, this guide starts with **anti-patterns** and shows how they can be improved using multiple design patterns.  
Engineers will learn how to choose and apply the right structure for the right situation.

**Live site**: [https://takt.dev/design-pattern/](https://takt.dev/design-pattern/)
