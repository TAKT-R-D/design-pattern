# 🧩 Green Software / Sustainable Architecture

## ✅ Overview

**Software design approach conscious of energy efficiency, carbon reduction, and resource optimization.**

## ✅ Problems Addressed

- Increase in energy consumption due to system expansion.
- "Invisibility" of CO2 emission accompanying cloud usage.
- Wasteful resource usage (Idle operation / Over-scale).

## ✅ Basic Philosophy & Rules

- Visualization of carbon efficiency (Carbon Intensity / GreenOps).
- Optimization of scheduling (Low carbon time zone).
- Utilization of Serverless / Auto-scale.
- Data reduction (Reduction of unnecessary data storage).
- Selection of energy-efficient algorithms.

## ✅ Suitable Applications

- Large-scale data processing infrastructure.
- Mobile / IoT requiring power saving.
- Enterprises requiring cloud optimization.

## ❌ Unsuitable Cases

- Environment where environmental data cannot be acquired.
- Small-scale systems where effect of energy efficiency is small.

## ✅ History

- Launch of Green Software Foundation.
- Cloud Sustainability became industry theme.

## ✅ Related Styles

- [Serverless](../topologies/serverless.md): Resource reduction during idle time.
- [Modular Monolith](../topologies/modular-monolith.md) / [Microservices](../topologies/microservices.md): Difference in resource efficiency by structure.
- FinOps: Affinity with cost optimization.

## ✅ Summary

Green Software is a concept for **Sustainable Software Design**,  
and is an architecture considering energy efficiency and CO2 reduction from design stage.
