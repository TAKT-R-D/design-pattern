# 🧩 DevOps

## ✅ Overview

**General term for culture, practices, and automation to eliminate the divide between Development (Dev) and Operations (Ops) and realize continuous delivery.**

## ✅ Problems Addressed

- Dev and Ops are divided, deployment is slow and prone to failure.
- Infrastructure changes are manual, causing frequent environment discrepancies.
- Troubles occur every release.
- Conflict structure of "Dev just makes it, Ops is just firefighter".

## ✅ Basic Philosophy & Rules

- Automated delivery pipeline by CI/CD.
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC).
- Standardization of monitoring / telemetry.
- Shared responsibility scope / Shared KPIs (DORA metrics etc.).
- Small, frequent, safe releases (Progressive Delivery).

## ✅ Suitable Applications

- SaaS requiring continuous improvement.
- Products performing high frequency delivery.
- Operation of distributed architectures like microservices.

## ❌ Unsuitable Cases

- Mission-critical operations emphasizing strict procedures (When cultural transformation is difficult).
- When organization is too small and Dev and Ops are not separated in the first place.

## ✅ History

- Spread starting from DevOps Days around 2009.
- Standardized with spread of Agile development and Cloud.

## ✅ Related Styles

- SRE: Operational quality engineering for reliability.
- Observability: Practice of observability.
- Team Topologies: Supports DevOps from organizational structure perspective.

## ✅ Summary
