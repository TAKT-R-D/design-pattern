# Expanding Design Power Through Combination

This chapter focuses on the **intentional combination of two design patterns** to achieve enhanced flexibility, modularity, and control in your application architecture. In real-world systems, design patterns are rarely used in isolation — they often appear in **complementary pairs** that strengthen each other’s role in solving complex design problems.

By examining these **common composite patterns**, we aim to deepen structural understanding and illustrate how such pairings lead to more maintainable and scalable solutions.

## Goals of This Chapter

- Understand **how and why** certain patterns are frequently combined in real-world applications.
- Learn to improve system design by **separating concerns** and **enhancing reusability** through structural composition.
- Develop the ability to **identify recurring composite structures** and apply them proactively in your own designs.

## Covered Pattern Combinations (7 Key Pairs)

| Combination                  | Description                                             |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Strategy × Template Method` | Fixed flow with flexible behavior injection             |
| `Observer × Mediator`        | Decoupled notification and orchestration control        |
| `Command × Memento`          | Command history tracking and state restoration          |
| `Facade × Iterator`          | Unified interface for traversing complex collections    |
| `Proxy × Strategy`           | Transparent control with swappable execution logic      |
| `State × Strategy`           | State-driven behavior delegation                        |
| `Bridge × Strategy`          | Decoupled abstraction and implementation with injection |

## Page Structure

Each combination is presented with:

- **Intent of the Combination** – What makes these patterns work well together
- **Common Use Cases** – Typical practical scenarios where this pair is applied
- **UML Class Diagram** – To visualize the structure
- **Code Example**: Concrete implementation (TypeScript / PHP / Python) — _final form only_.
- **Explanation** – Highlighting the motivation, structure, and benefits

## Supplement: Multi-Pattern Design (3 or more)

In production-grade systems, it is common to find **combinations of three or more patterns** working in unison. However, for clarity and learnability, this chapter focuses on **two-pattern combinations** as a practical baseline.

We provide an overview of more advanced multi-pattern compositions in the supplemental section:  
 **Appendix: Evolution Maps of Composite Patterns**  
This appendix includes **mermaid-style graphs** showing common progression paths and pattern relationship diagrams.

## Summary

Combining design patterns is not simply about adding features — it’s about designing a system where **each part reinforces the overall structure**. These composite patterns offer practical templates for building systems that are **robust, flexible, and easy to evolve**.

Through this chapter, you’ll gain tools to move beyond isolated pattern usage and toward **composable, scalable design thinking** grounded in real-world application needs.
