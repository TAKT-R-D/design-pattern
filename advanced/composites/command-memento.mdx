# ðŸ§© Command Ã— Memento

## âœ… Combined Intent

- Use the `Command` pattern to encapsulate operations (like input) as objects and enable history tracking.
- Use the `Memento` pattern to capture and restore the internal state of objects.

This combination enables a structure where you can track **what was done** and also **what the system's state was** at that time â€” allowing both command replay and full state rollback.

## âœ… Common Use Cases

- Applications like text editors or drawing tools where Undo/Redo is essential.
- Tools that require change tracking (e.g., batch updates, system configurations).
- When both user actions and internal states need to be recorded and reverted.

    class TypeCommand {
        -editor: TextEditor
        -text: string
        -backup: EditorMemento
        +execute()
        +undo()
    }

    class TextEditor {
        -content: string
        +append(text)
        +getContent()
        +save(): EditorMemento
        +restore(memento: EditorMemento)
    }

    class EditorMemento {
        -state: string
        +getState()
    }

    class CommandHistory {
        -history: Command[]
        +executeCommand(command)
        +undo()
    }

    Command <|-- TypeCommand
    TypeCommand --> TextEditor
    TypeCommand --> EditorMemento
    TextEditor --> EditorMemento
    CommandHistory --> Command

  <TabItem value="ts" label="TypeScript">
    <CodeBlock language="ts">{tsCode}</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="php" label="PHP">
    <CodeBlock language="php">{phpCode}</CodeBlock>

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## âœ… Explanation

- `TextEditor` holds the current text and acts as the **Receiver**, also implementing state snapshot functionality (`Memento`).
- `TypeCommand` represents a text input operation as a `Command`, and saves a snapshot before execution.
- `CommandHistory` stores the list of commands and provides `undo()` functionality.

By combining these patterns, we can **decouple input behavior and state recovery**, allowing for a clean and maintainable Undo/Redo system.

## âœ… Summary

- **Command**: Encapsulates operations and enables command history.
- **Memento**: Captures and restores object state.
- Their combination allows tracking of both actions and states.
- Ideal for implementing undoable workflows and reliable state transitions.
