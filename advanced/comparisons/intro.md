# Understanding the Differences Between Patterns

## ✅ Purpose of This Chapter

Many design patterns share similar structures or intentions.  
This chapter aims to clearly compare such patterns side by side and help you understand **when and why to choose one over the other during design decisions**.

Have you ever wondered:

> - "How is Strategy different from Template Method?"
> - "Aren’t Adapter and Bridge structurally the same?"
> - "Isn't Command just another form of Strategy?"

To answer these questions, we analyze patterns from key perspectives such as structure, flexibility, reusability, runtime adaptability, and testability.

## ✅ What This Chapter Covers

This chapter provides side-by-side comparisons for **10 commonly confused pairs of design patterns**:

- Strategy vs Template Method
- Adapter vs Bridge
- Factory Method vs Abstract Factory
- Decorator vs Proxy
- State vs Strategy
- Command vs Strategy
- Observer vs Mediator
- Proxy vs Facade
- Singleton vs Dependency Injection
- Command vs Template Method

Each comparison page follows a consistent format with the following sections:

- ✅ Purpose of Comparison
- ✅ Comparison Overview
- ✅ Similarities
- ✅ Key Differences
- ✅ When to Choose Which
- ✅ UML Class Diagram (to visualize structural differences)
- ✅ Practical Tips for Implementation
- ✅ Summary

## ✅ How to Use This Chapter

This chapter is designed to be useful in the following scenarios:

- When reviewing designs and evaluating pattern choices
- When you know the pattern names but want to better articulate their differences
- When you want to explain design rationale clearly to team members

The focus is **not on code refactoring**, but rather on **understanding conceptual and structural differences**.

The goal of this chapter is to **develop the ability to articulate pattern choices clearly and confidently**.  
It is not just about learning names—**it is about strengthening your design reasoning and communication**.
