# Practical Design Pattern Guide

## ✅ Purpose and Intent

This chapter focuses on the **practical application of design patterns to real-world development challenges**.  
Rather than discussing patterns in the abstract, it starts from common issues encountered in implementation  
— such as "difficult to test," "state management is messy," or "authorization is hard to maintain" —  
and shows **how combinations of design patterns can be used to solve them effectively**.

By leveraging pattern synergy, this chapter addresses key software design concerns such as:

- Separation of concerns
- Flexibility and extensibility
- Testability
- Clear boundaries between state and operations

The aim is to strengthen the reader's **ability to apply patterns strategically** by emphasizing reproducible structures and judgment criteria relevant to actual development.

## ✅ Structure and How to Read

Each section follows a consistent structure:

- **Problem Overview** – Describes practical problems encountered in real projects
- **Solution Overview** – Maps design patterns to specific solution strategies
- **Pattern Synergy** – Explains how the selected patterns work together
- **UML Class Diagram** – Visual representation of structure and responsibilities
- **Explanation** – Describes roles, interactions, and structural benefits
- **Practical Notes** – Use cases and implementation benefits
- **Summary** – Key takeaways and value of the proposed structure

This chapter **focuses on thought process and architectural clarity**, rather than source code.

## ✅ Use Case Coverage (8 Examples)

| Situation / Problem                      | Pattern Combination  |
| ---------------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| Difficult to test                        | DI + Strategy        |
| Complex UI state updates                 | Observer + State     |
| Need to implement Undo/Redo              | Command + Memento    |
| API calls are heavy and slow             | Proxy + Flyweight    |
| Coordinating multiple UI components      | Composite + Mediator |
| Need to authorize certain operations     | Proxy + Command      |
| Messy configuration and dependency setup | Factory + Singleton  |
| Need to generate authenticated resources | Factory + Proxy      |
