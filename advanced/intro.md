# Advanced Design Patterns

## âœ… Purpose and Intent

The **Advanced** section goes beyond understanding individual design patterns and focuses on enhancing practical design skills through the lenses of  
**pattern combinations, comparative decision-making, and real-world applicability**.

It systematically organizes knowledge that supports **effective design decisions in real projects**, including:

- The effects of combining patterns structurally
- Key differences and trade-offs between similar patterns
- Practical usage of patterns to solve common implementation challenges

## âœ… Chapter Overview and Roles

### ðŸ”· Combining Design Patterns

- **Purpose**: To highlight design benefits that emerge when two patterns are intentionally combinedâ€”benefits not achievable by either alone.
- **Content**: Illustrated with class diagrams and code examples, this chapter emphasizes reusability, separation of concerns, and structural flexibility.

### ðŸ”· Comparing Similar Patterns

- **Purpose**: To clarify the distinctions between structurally or conceptually similar patterns and guide their appropriate usage.
- **Content**: Includes 10 comparison pairs (e.g., Strategy vs Template Method, Adapter vs Bridge), with structured charts and explanation of decision factors.

### ðŸ”· Practical Pattern Applications

- **Purpose**: To provide actionable solutions for common development issuesâ€”such as difficulty testing or implementing Undo/Redoâ€”by applying multiple patterns in combination.
- **Content**: Each case starts from a real-world problem and shows how to resolve it using well-structured and reusable pattern combinations.

## âœ… Goal: Elevating Your Design Skillset

- Systematically strengthen knowledge from three perspectives: **selection, composition, and application** of design patterns
- Gain a mindset focused on **structural intent and reusability**, not just code improvement
- Develop skills that contribute to **long-term architectural quality**, including design reviews and shared infrastructure design

Through this section, we aim to help you move from **knowing design patterns to mastering their practical use**,  
enabling you to make confident, structured design decisions in real-world engineering contexts.
