# Refactoring Task

## Overview

This exercise addresses a design where a new business logic connects directly to a legacy file-saving API.  
The goal is to analyze this structure from the perspectives of **extensibility, maintainability, readability, and testability**, and consider abstraction through an Adapter and possible redesign.

## Initial Code

In the following example, the `ExportService` directly depends on `LegacyFileSaver`, forcefully adapting data to match its interface.  
As a result, **the new code is burdened with format conversions and compatibility logic**, leading to poor separation of concerns.

<Tabs groupId="language">
  <TabItem value="ts" label="TypeScript">
    <CodeBlock language="ts">{tsCode}</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="php" label="PHP">
    <CodeBlock language="php">{phpCode}</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="python" label="Python">
    <CodeBlock language="python">{pyCode}</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Question 1: What are the design issues in this code?

List and explain the structural issues using the following points as guidance:

- **Tight coupling with the legacy API (`LegacyFileSaver`)**, making reuse and replacement difficult
- **Responsibility confusion** due to format conversions and compatibility logic being mixed in the new code
- **The caller handles interface mismatches directly**, breaking decoupling principles
- **Low testability** due to dependency on real environments or legacy APIs

## Question 2: How can this be refactored into a more flexible and maintainable structure?

Organize your improvement strategy around the following points:

- How to **abstract away the legacy API** so that the new design doesnâ€™t need to be aware of its details
- How to make the system adaptable to alternative saving mechanisms (e.g., cloud storage, database)
- How to **invert dependencies** and enable implementation swapping via interfaces

### Example: Candidate Design Patterns

| Pattern Name | Purpose and Effect                                                                  |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Adapter`    | Wraps the legacy API and adapts it to be compatible with the new design             |
| `Facade`     | Provides a simplified interface for multiple legacy API calls                       |
| `Strategy`   | Allows switching between different saving logics, supporting both legacy and new    |
| `Bridge`     | Separates abstraction from implementation to allow flexible changes in storage type |

## Optional Extensions

- If modern APIs (e.g., REST or cloud storage) are introduced alongside legacy ones, how should the structure evolve?
- If a common interface for saving logic is introduced, what responsibilities should be extracted and separated?

## Suggested Output Format (for review or team discussion)

- List of structural issues (minimum three)
- Refactoring strategy and rationale
- Proposed pattern(s) and design benefits
- (Optional) Simplified class/interface diagram showing the refactored structure
