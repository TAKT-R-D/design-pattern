# Forced Compatibility

## Description

### What does it look like?

- New code **directly calls** legacy (outdated) interfaces
- The caller **manually adapts** to differences in API specifications, cluttering the logic
- Despite mismatched formats or behavior, the integration is forced for the sake of functionality

### Why is it a problem?

- The calling side **takes on the responsibility** of adapting/transforming the data, blurring design boundaries
- Any change in the API or specification **ripples across many parts of the codebase**
- Makes testing or replacing the dependency **difficult**

## Bad Example of the Anti-pattern

<Tabs groupId="language">
  <TabItem value="ts" label="TypeScript">
    <CodeBlock language="ts">{tsCode}</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="php" label="PHP">
    <CodeBlock language="php">{phpCode}</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="python" label="Python">
    <CodeBlock language="python">{pyCode}</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Issues:

- `ReportGenerator` is tightly coupled to `LegacyPrinter`’s method names and formatting
- Interface mismatch is not abstracted; legacy and modern design philosophies are mixed
- Logic like converting text to uppercase is embedded in `ReportGenerator`, violating the SRP
- Cannot easily switch to a new printer class or external printing API
- Cannot replace with a mock printer during testing
- As usage of `LegacyPrinter` increases, similar transformation logic is duplicated throughout the codebase
- Any change to the legacy interface **impacts all usage sites**

## Refactoring by Pattern

### Design patterns that can address this

| Pattern   | Overview                                                    | Main Refactoring Approach                         |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `Adapter` | Acts as a “bridge” to match interface differences           | Adds a translation layer between old and new APIs |
| `Facade`  | Hides subsystem complexity and provides a clean entry point | Use when you want to simplify usage               |
| `Proxy`   | Controls access to objects                                  | Useful for access control, caching, or lazy calls |
