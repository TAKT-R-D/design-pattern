# Refactoring Task

## Overview

This task focuses on improving a drawing service implementation that lacks support for **undo/redo functionality**.  
Currently, the system does not retain any user interaction history, making it impossible to revert or reapply actions.  
You'll examine how to refactor the design to **enable state preservation and rollback**.

## Initial Code

The following example shows a `DrawService` class that draws shapes (e.g., circles, squares) on a canvas.  
However, the class does not store any operation history or state snapshots, so user actions cannot be undone or replayed.

<Tabs groupId="language">
  <TabItem value="ts" label="TypeScript">
    <CodeBlock language="ts">{tsCode}</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="php" label="PHP">
    <CodeBlock language="php">{phpCode}</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="python" label="Python">
    <CodeBlock language="python">{pyCode}</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Question 1: What are the structural problems in this code?

List and describe specific issues using the following criteria:

- **State accumulates but cannot be reverted**
- **No operation history is stored**, so rollback and redo are unsupported
- **Missing common UI/UX feature: Undo/Redo**
- **Difficult to track or verify user actions**

## Question 2: How can the code be improved to support operation history and restoration?

Use the following points to organize your proposal:

- How should each operation (e.g., drawing) be stored as history?
- How should state recording and restoration (object/snapshot-based) be designed?
- Which patterns can help implement command history and rollback support?

### Example: Candidate Design Patterns

| Pattern Name     | Purpose and Effect                                                           |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Command`        | Encapsulate each user action as a command object that supports undo/redo     |
| `Memento`        | Store snapshots of object state and allow complete restoration               |
| `Prototype`      | Clone object states to simplify versioning and recovery                      |
| `State` (helper) | Encapsulate current state as an object to support transitions and visibility |

## Optional Extensions

- How should redo functionality be implemented along with undo?
- What features would be needed in real-world use cases, such as **maximum history size** or **user-specific history**?

## Suggested Output Format (for review or team discussion)

- List of structural issues (3 or more)
- Refactoring strategy and reasons for selected patterns
- High-level redesign (e.g., flow of storing/restoring history, command abstraction approach)
