# No Undo/Redo History

## Description

### What does it look like?

- User actions are not recorded, so **undo/redo functionality is unavailable**
- There is **no way to revert the side effects** of an operation
- Without a history, it is difficult to **restore or roll back system state**

### Why is it a problem?

- **Poor user experience (UX)** — no way to undo mistakes
- Recovery from input errors requires redoing or restoring manually
- Difficult to **debug or trace issues** in complex state changes

## Bad Example of the Anti-pattern

<Tabs groupId="language">
  <TabItem value="ts" label="TypeScript">
    <CodeBlock language="ts">{tsCode}</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="php" label="PHP">
    <CodeBlock language="php">{phpCode}</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="python" label="Python">
    <CodeBlock language="python">{pyCode}</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Issues:

- Input is applied directly to the internal state — **no way to undo**
- `type()` modifies the content immediately, making **history management difficult**

## Refactoring by Pattern

### Design patterns that can address this

| Pattern   | Overview                                                               | Main Refactoring Approach           |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `Command` | Encapsulate operations as command objects and manage execute/undo/redo | Store and control execution history |
| `Memento` | Capture and restore full snapshots of an object’s state                | Enable complete state restoration   |
