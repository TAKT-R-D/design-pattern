# Scattered Instantiation

## Description

### What does it look like?

- Classes are instantiated using `new` **directly and repeatedly throughout the codebase**
- Hard to track which classes are used where, leading to **unclear dependencies**
- Instantiation logic is **scattered**, making management difficult

### Why is it a problem?

- Results in a **fragile design** that is hard to modify or replace with new implementations
- Difficult to unit test (hard to inject mocks)
- Object creation logic is often copy-pasted in multiple places
- **Instance management becomes tangled like spaghetti code**

## Bad Example of the Anti-pattern

<Tabs groupId="language">
  <TabItem value="ts" label="TypeScript">
    <CodeBlock language="ts">{tsCode}</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="php" label="PHP">
    <CodeBlock language="php">{phpCode}</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="python" label="Python">
    <CodeBlock language="python">{pyCode}</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Issues:

- `Logger` is instantiated directly inside `UserService`
- Other services may also repeat `new Logger()`, leading to duplication
- **Difficult to reuse the logger logic as a shared component**

## Refactoring by Pattern

### Design patterns that can address this

| Pattern            | Overview                                   | Main Refactoring Approach                  |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| `Factory Method`   | Delegate object creation to a subclass     | Make instantiation logic extensible        |
| `Abstract Factory` | Group related objects into a factory       | Abstract creation logic for easy switching |
| `Builder`          | Clarify complex creation steps             | Separate construction steps for clarity    |
| `Singleton`        | Restrict to a single instance and reuse it | Useful for shared global state             |
