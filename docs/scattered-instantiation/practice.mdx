# Refactoring Task

## Overview

In this exercise, you will analyze a `Notifier` class implementation in which an external dependency (`Mailer`) is instantiated with `new` each time it is needed.  
Identify the design issues this introduces, and propose refactoring strategies that improve flexibility and testability.

## Initial Code

The following code defines a `Notifier` class responsible for sending notifications to users.  
It directly instantiates the `Mailer` internally, which works initially, but could lead to maintainability and extensibility problems over time.

<Tabs groupId="language">
  <TabItem value="ts" label="TypeScript">
    <CodeBlock language="ts">{tsCode}</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="php" label="PHP">
    <CodeBlock language="php">{phpCode}</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="python" label="Python">
    <CodeBlock language="python">{pyCode}</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Question 1: What are the design issues in this code?

List and explain the design problems based on the following aspects:

- **Testability** (Is it possible to replace `Mailer` for testing?)
- **Flexibility** (What if the type of mailer needs to be changed?)
- **Dependency management** (Is `Notifier` too tightly coupled to `Mailer`?)
- **Conformance to design principles** (e.g., the Dependency Inversion Principle)

## Question 2: How should the design be improved?

Propose improvements based on the following considerations:

- How can `Notifier` be decoupled from the internal instantiation of `Mailer`?
- How can the `Mailer` be replaced during unit testing?
- What benefits arise from applying **Dependency Injection**?

### Example: Design Pattern Candidates

| Pattern Name           | Purpose and Effects                                                                   |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Factory Method`       | Extracts object creation logic and allows switching implementations as needed         |
| `Abstract Factory`     | Provides a group of related objects (e.g., `Mailer`, `Logger`) as a unified interface |
| `Builder`              | Separates construction steps and enables flexible, step-by-step initialization        |
| `Singleton`            | Ensures only one instance exists globally and is reused across the system             |
| `Dependency Injection` | Injects dependencies externally for better flexibility, testability, and decoupling   |

## Optional Extensions

- If notification methods include `Slack` or `LINE` in addition to email, how would you adapt the design?
- If the test environment requires a mock mailer that logs instead of sending, how would you design for this flexibility?

## Suggested Output Format (for review or study groups)

- List of at least three structural problems
- Refactoring approach and the reason for choosing specific patterns
- Design rationale and improvements (with optional sketches or pseudocode)
