# Excessive Branching

## Description

### What does it look like?

- Excessive use of `if` / `else if` / `switch` makes the code hard to read
- Logic for handling conditions is duplicated in multiple places
- As conditions increase, it becomes **a breeding ground for bugs** and **decreases maintainability**

### Why is it a problem?

- Requires reviewing **all conditions** during modifications
- **Single functions or classes become bloated with responsibility**
- Difficult to unit test due to tightly coupled conditional logic
- **Hard to extend (violates the Open/Closed Principle)**

## Bad Example of the Anti-pattern

<Tabs groupId="language">
  <TabItem value="ts" label="TypeScript">
    <CodeBlock language="ts">{tsCode}</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="php" label="PHP">
    <CodeBlock language="php">{phpCode}</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="python" label="Python">
    <CodeBlock language="python">{pyCode}</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Issues:

- As `if/else` blocks accumulate, readability, testability, and the risk of bugs increase
- Every time a new `userType` is introduced, the function body must be editedâ€”making safe extension difficult
- Discount logic is embedded directly, making it hard to reuse or centralize

## Refactoring by Pattern

### Design patterns that can address this

| Pattern                   | Overview                                | Main Refactoring Approach                            |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `Strategy`                | Extract conditional behavior            | Allows behavior to be swapped at runtime             |
| `State`                   | Map each state to its own behavior      | Let state objects encapsulate condition logic        |
| `Command`                 | Encapsulate each condition as a command | Enables recording and undoing actions                |
| `Chain of Responsibility` | Pass responsibility through a chain     | Express conditions as a natural flow                 |
| `Interpreter`             | Parse and evaluate structured rules     | Separate complex condition logic as a domain grammar |
