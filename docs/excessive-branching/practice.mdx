# Refactoring Task

## Overview

In this exercise, you'll analyze a code sample in which notification messages are formatted differently based on the user type.  
The current implementation relies heavily on `if/else` branching, and you are expected to identify the design issues related to this structure.  
The goal is to propose a refactoring plan that improves responsibility separation, flexibility, and extensibility.

## Initial Code

The following example generates notification messages based on the user's role (e.g., guest, member, admin).  
As the number of user types grows, consider how this implementation affects maintainability and readability.

<Tabs groupId="language">
  <TabItem value="ts" label="TypeScript">
    <CodeBlock language="ts">{tsCode}</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="php" label="PHP">
    <CodeBlock language="php">{phpCode}</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="python" label="Python">
    <CodeBlock language="python">{pyCode}</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Question 1: What are the design issues in this code?

List the key design problems with specific references to the code structure. Consider the following aspects:

- **Low maintainability due to tightly concentrated branching logic**
- **The scope of required changes when new conditions are added**
- **The risk of side effects from modifying existing logic**
- **Difficulty in testing condition-specific behavior independently**

## Question 2: How can this implementation be refactored to be more flexible and extensible?

Propose a refactoring plan that addresses the following:

- How to separate and delegate behavior based on each user type
- How to minimize code modifications when adding or changing conditions
- Which design patterns could be applied, and what are their intentions and benefits?

### Example: Design Pattern Candidates

| Pattern                   | Intent and Benefits                                                               |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Strategy`                | Encapsulates formatting logic for each user type into swappable objects           |
| `State`                   | Delegates output behavior based on the userâ€™s current state                       |
| `Command`                 | Wraps formatting logic as commands that can be tracked and undone/redone          |
| `Chain of Responsibility` | Handles the message by the first eligible handler in a flexible, ordered pipeline |
| `Interpreter` (advanced)  | Encodes conditional rules as syntax and evaluates them externally for flexibility |

## Optional Extensions

- If message content needs to vary by language (e.g., English, Japanese), how would you refactor the structure?
- If message templates need to reflect user groups, roles, or custom preferences, how should the system be designed?

## Suggested Output Format (for team review or study groups)

- A list of at least three structural issues
- Refactoring policy and rationale
- Proposed design patterns and justification
- Optional: simplified sketch of the refactored class or architecture
