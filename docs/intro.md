# Introduction

This document is designed to help you **practically learn design patterns** by starting from common anti-patterns and exploring how to refactor them.  
Rather than memorizing design patterns in isolation, the focus is on recognizing **familiar structures**, understanding the **design issues** they pose, and discovering **viable refactoring options**.

## Chapter Structure

Each anti-pattern chapter follows a consistent structure:

1. **Bad Example of the Anti-Pattern**  
   A concise example of a commonly seen structure along with its problems

2. **Refactoring by Patterns**  
   Multiple refactoring solutions using relevant design patterns

3. **Pattern Comparison**  
   Cross-pattern comparison of pros, cons, and appropriate vs. inappropriate use cases

4. **Choosing the Right Pattern**  
   Decision-making criteria and structured heuristics for choosing a suitable pattern

5. **Team Discussion Snippets**
   Real-world conversational cues and questions for design reviews or implementation debates

6. **Refactoring Task**
   Practical exercises placed at the end of each chapter to reinforce pattern usage

## Suggested Reading Styles

| Reading Style            | Description                                                    | Ideal For                                           |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Reference Use            | Jump straight to relevant anti-patterns when needed            | Real-world design/code reviews                      |
| Before/After Walkthrough | Explore refactoring examples and compare the code step-by-step | Developers learning through code                    |
| Exercise-First           | Try the exercises first, then read the solutions               | Readers who prefer hands-on learning                |
| Pattern-Centric          | Follow a specific design pattern across multiple chapters      | Intermediate to advanced readers focused on mastery |

## Design Philosophy

- **Train Structural Intuition**  
  The goal is to articulate "why this structure works" in your own words

- **Focus on Structural Solutions, Not Just Pattern Names**  
  Emphasis is placed on understanding the structural nature of a solution, not just memorizing names

- **Think Beyond Specific Languages**  
  Code examples are provided in multiple languages to highlight structural patterns over syntax

## Use Cases

- As a guide for structuring design discussions and review meetings
- As a training material for onboarding or mentoring junior-to-mid-level engineers
- As a self-study workbook for improving design skills through refactoring
