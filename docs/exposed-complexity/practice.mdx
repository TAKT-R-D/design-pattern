# Refactoring Task

## Overview

This task focuses on the purchase process where the function `completePurchase()`  
**manually orchestrates a sequence of operations**â€”inventory check, payment, and receipt issuance.  
You'll examine how to refactor this design by applying **abstraction and responsibility separation** principles.

## Initial Code

The following code shows a purchase workflow using multiple service classes.  
However, the **entire logic is exposed in the calling function**, making the structure hard to reuse, test, or extend.

<Tabs groupId="language">
  <TabItem value="ts" label="TypeScript">
    <CodeBlock language="ts">{tsCode}</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="php" label="PHP">
    <CodeBlock language="php">{phpCode}</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="python" label="Python">
    <CodeBlock language="python">{pyCode}</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Question 1: What are the structural problems in this code?

Identify and describe the issues using the following criteria:

- **The caller has direct knowledge of multiple services (tight coupling)**
- **Control flow, branching, and error handling are concentrated in one place**
- **Difficult to reuse or rearrange the logic**
- **Violates SRP (Single Responsibility Principle) and lacks change tolerance**

## Question 2: How can this structure be improved for better flexibility and maintainability?

Organize your proposal using the following perspectives:

- Where should the control flow logic be delegated (caller / dedicated service / wrapper)?
- Can the caller be simplified to handle only minimal interaction?
- How can the structure support future changes (inserting or replacing steps)?

### Example: Candidate Design Patterns

| Pattern Name | Purpose and Effect                                                                 |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Facade`     | Consolidates a complex series of operations behind a simple interface              |
| `Proxy`      | Allows pre/post processing like logging, authentication, etc., around core logic   |
| `Command`    | Encapsulates each step as a command that can be executed, recorded, or undone      |
| `Iterator`   | Enables sequential execution of steps with flexible ordering and structure changes |

## Optional Extensions

- If the flow needs to support **extra steps** like notification or point rewards, how can this be achieved without modifying existing code?
- If this purchase logic is reused across multiple channels (e.g., Web, batch), what differences should be expected in the way it is invoked?

## Suggested Output Format (for review or team discussion)

- List of design problems (3 or more)
- Refactoring strategy and reasoning for pattern selection
- Overview of the improved structure (separation of responsibilities, encapsulated logic, etc.)
