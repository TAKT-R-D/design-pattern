# Exposed Complexity

## Description

### What does it look like?

- The caller **manually executes a series of complex steps**
- Multiple components are composed and coordinated **every time they are used**
- The **overall intent is difficult to grasp** due to scattered logic

### Why is it a problem?

- The same complex logic tends to be **repeated across the codebase**
- When changes are needed, **every usage site must be updated**
- The caller takes on too much responsibility, **breaking separation of concerns**

## Bad Example of the Anti-pattern

<Tabs groupId="language">
  <TabItem value="ts" label="TypeScript">
    <CodeBlock language="ts">{tsCode}</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="php" label="PHP">
    <CodeBlock language="php">{phpCode}</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="python" label="Python">
    <CodeBlock language="python">{pyCode}</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Issues:

- The caller manually coordinates three components â€” **exposing a complex workflow**
- Authentication, data fetching, and audit logging are **all handled by the caller**
- If similar logic is needed elsewhere, **code duplication and complexity grow**

## Refactoring by Pattern

### Design patterns that can address this

| Pattern    | Overview                                        | Main Refactoring Approach                                  |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Facade`   | Provide a unified interface to a complex system | Simplifies and unifies the process invocation              |
| `Proxy`    | Intermediates access to add or control behavior | Useful for caching, access control, or lazy initialization |
| `Iterator` | Encapsulates traversal logic over a collection  | Abstracts and standardizes iteration over complex data     |
