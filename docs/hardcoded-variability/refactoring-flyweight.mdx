# ðŸ§© Flyweight Pattern

## âœ… Intent

- Share objects that contain **invariant, common data** to reduce memory usage
- Extract and externalize **varying data (context)** while keeping shared logic centralized

## âœ… Motivation

- Avoid creating numerous nearly identical objects when **only a few fields vary**
- Consolidate templates, formatting rules, or behavior that is reused across many instances

## âœ… When to Use

- You need to manage **a large number of similar objects**
- Only part of each objectâ€™s state differs (e.g., label text, position, user ID)
- You want to **optimize memory or avoid duplication** in UI, graphics, reporting, etc.

## âœ… Code Example

<Tabs groupId="language">
  <TabItem value="ts" label="TypeScript">
    <CodeBlock language="ts">{tsCode}</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="php" label="PHP">
    <CodeBlock language="php">{phpCode}</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="python" label="Python">
    <CodeBlock language="python">{pyCode}</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## âœ… Explanation

This code uses the `Flyweight` pattern to share a common **notification template** across many instances. Each `Notification` only stores **dynamic context**, like user or message content.

The flyweight stores the static structure (`header`, `footer`, etc.), and is reused wherever possible.

### 1. Flyweight Pattern Overview

- **Flyweight**: Shared object containing immutable data  
  â†’ `NotificationTemplate`

- **Context**: Stores varying state and uses the Flyweight object  
  â†’ `Notification`

- **Client**: Creates many `Notification` instances reusing the same `NotificationTemplate`

### 2. Key Classes and Responsibilities

- `NotificationTemplate`

  - Holds common, reusable message format logic
  - Formats full message from a header, content, and footer

- `Notification`

  - Holds contextual, variable data (e.g., user and message)
  - Delegates formatting to the shared `NotificationTemplate`

- Client Code
  - Shares a single instance of `NotificationTemplate` and uses it to send many personalized notifications

    class NotificationTemplate {
        +header: string
        +footer: string
        +format(user: string, body: string): string
    }

    class Notification {
        -user: string
        -message: string
        -template: NotificationTemplate
        +send(): void
    }

    Notification --> NotificationTemplate : uses
```

### 4. Benefits of the Flyweight Pattern

- **Reduced memory usage**: Share large, constant structures across instances
- **Simplified logic**: Common formatting or display logic is centralized
- **High performance**: Especially useful when working with UIs, game objects, icons, etc.

This design is ideal when building scalable systems that handle large numbers of small objects with repeated structureâ€”particularly in UI, graphics, or reporting layers.
