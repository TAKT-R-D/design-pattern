# Hardcoded Variability

## Description

### What does it look like?

- The **variable part of the logic** is hardcoded directly and not separated from the fixed part
- “Slightly different” behaviors are mixed into a common flow, making **reuse difficult**
- Even though the overall flow is the same, the entire logic is **duplicated for small differences**

### Why is it a problem?

- Without clear separation between shared and differing parts, **changes are hard to make**
- Similar but slightly different code grows, increasing the risk of **bugs and maintenance overhead**
- The code lacks flexibility, making **feature extension and switching difficult**

## Bad Example of the Anti-pattern

<Tabs groupId="language">
  <TabItem value="ts" label="TypeScript">
    <CodeBlock language="ts">{tsCode}</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="php" label="PHP">
    <CodeBlock language="php">{phpCode}</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="python" label="Python">
    <CodeBlock language="python">{pyCode}</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Issues:

- Email and Slack notifications **mix shared structure with their differences**
- Every time a new channel (e.g., LINE, SMS) is added, **similar methods are created again**
- The shared logic becomes cluttered, resulting in **poor testability and maintainability**

## Refactoring by Pattern

### Design patterns that can address this

| Pattern           | Overview                                                  | Main Refactoring Approach                                |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Template Method` | Standardize the flow and define differences in subclasses | Prevent duplication and improve reusability              |
| `Strategy`        | Allow behavior to be swapped                              | Easier to replace and test                               |
| `Bridge`          | Separate abstraction from implementation                  | Clarify axes of change and enable flexibility            |
| `Flyweight`       | Share common state to reduce object count                 | Minimize redundant data                                  |
| `Prototype`       | Clone instances from a template                           | Reuse initialization and generate variations efficiently |
