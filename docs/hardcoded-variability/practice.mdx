# Refactoring Task

## Overview

This task addresses a report generation process in which **common logic (e.g., start/end processing)**  
and **format-specific logic (PDF/CSV/HTML output)** are tightly coupled and written together.  
The goal is to improve **reusability of shared steps** and **extensibility of format-specific behavior**  
by applying appropriate structural refactoring.

## Initial Code

The following code generates reports in PDF, CSV, and HTML formats.  
However, the format-specific logic is **mixed directly with the shared steps** (e.g., logging),  
making the code hard to maintain and extend.

<Tabs groupId="language">
  <TabItem value="ts" label="TypeScript">
    <CodeBlock language="ts">{tsCode}</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="php" label="PHP">
    <CodeBlock language="php">{phpCode}</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="python" label="Python">
    <CodeBlock language="python">{pyCode}</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Question 1: What are the structural problems in this code?

Consider the following aspects when listing the issues:

- **Common logic is duplicated across multiple methods**
- **Format-specific behavior is mixed with shared control flow**
- **High modification cost when adding new formats**
- **Hard to isolate and reuse shared steps for testing or maintenance**

## Question 2: How can this structure be improved for better flexibility and maintainability?

Outline your proposal considering these points:

- How can shared logic (pre/post) be separated from variable logic?
- How can the **variable logic be localized**, and **common logic centralized**?
- What structure supports a **template + plugin-style composition**?

### Example: Candidate Design Patterns

| Pattern Name      | Purpose and Effect                                                                  |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Template Method` | Centralizes shared behavior in a base class, allowing subclasses to override parts  |
| `Strategy`        | Delegates format-specific logic to interchangeable objects                          |
| `Bridge`          | Separates abstraction from implementation for flexible format-function combinations |
| `Flyweight`       | Shares common state/data to reduce memory usage and instance cost                   |
| `Prototype`       | Allows pre-configured output logic to be cloned and customized                      |

## Optional Extensions

- How would the design scale if new formats like Markdown, JSON, or Excel are added?
- If post-processing (e.g., save, compress, send) needs to be inserted,  
  which structure is most adaptable for such extensions?

## Suggested Output Format (for review or team discussion)

- List of structural issues (at least 3)
- Refactoring strategy and reasoning for selected patterns
- Overview of the improved structure (abstraction of output flow, use of inheritance or delegation, etc.)
