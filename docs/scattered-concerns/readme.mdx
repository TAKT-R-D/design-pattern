# Scattered Concerns

## Description

### What does it look like?

- **Logging logic and configuration access are written inconsistently across the codebase**
- Each part of the system logs messages or loads config values **in its own way, lacking consistency**
- Implementation of logs and configs tends to vary **depending on the developer**

### Why is it a problem?

- **Low maintainability and poor reusability**
- When log format or destination needs to change, **the impact is widespread**
- Incorrect config access or repeated loading may lead to **performance issues and bugs**

## Bad Example of the Anti-pattern

<Tabs groupId="language">
  <TabItem value="ts" label="TypeScript">
    <CodeBlock language="ts">{tsCode}</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="php" label="PHP">
    <CodeBlock language="php">{phpCode}</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="python" label="Python">
    <CodeBlock language="python">{pyCode}</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Issues:

- Direct use of `console.log()` → **Must update every log when the format changes**
- Direct access to `process.env` → **No centralized configuration management**
- **Responsibility is scattered and reuse is difficult**

## Refactoring by Pattern

### Design patterns that can address this

| Pattern     | Overview                                               | Main Refactoring Approach               |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------- |
| `Singleton` | Restrict instance to one across the application        | Manage logs and configs as shared state |
| `Facade`    | Provide a simplified API for logging and config access | Create a unified interface for use      |
