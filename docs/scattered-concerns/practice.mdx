# Refactoring Task

## Overview

In this task, you'll analyze a codebase where multiple classes (`ApiClient`, `BatchJob`) independently perform logging and configuration loading.  
The goal is to identify issues such as **scattered and duplicated logic**, **wide change impact**, and to explore directions for refactoring toward better maintainability and extensibility.

## Initial Code

The following example shows an API client and a batch job class, both directly using `console.log` and `getenv`.  
There is no unified logging format or centralized configuration management, leading to problems in **reusability and maintainability**.

<Tabs groupId="language">
  <TabItem value="ts" label="TypeScript">
    <CodeBlock language="ts">{tsCode}</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="php" label="PHP">
    <CodeBlock language="php">{phpCode}</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="python" label="Python">
    <CodeBlock language="python">{pyCode}</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Question 1: What are the design issues in this code?

List and describe structural problems, considering the following points:

- **Duplicate logging logic scattered across multiple classes**
- **Responsibility for configuration loading is fragmented**
- **No consistent logging format or log levels**, making future changes difficult
- **No abstraction for infrastructure concerns such as logging and configuration**

## Question 2: How can this structure be improved for better maintainability and extensibility?

Organize your refactoring plan based on the following points:

- How to standardize and centralize logging and its format
- How to decouple configuration access from individual classes
- How to design a shared infrastructure layer reusable across the entire application

### Example: Candidate Design Patterns

| Pattern Name      | Purpose and Effect                                                                  |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Singleton`       | Centralize logging and configuration logic into a single globally shared instance   |
| `Facade`          | Provide a simplified API for complex logging/configuration logic                    |
| `Adapter`         | Wrap external logging/config libraries with app-specific interfaces                 |
| `Service Locator` | Centralize access to common services, eliminating the need for manual instantiation |

## Optional Extensions

- If you need to switch log output destinations (console, file, database), how should the design evolve?
- If configuration values are loaded from DB or external APIs instead of `.env`, what impact will that have and how should it be handled?

## Suggested Output Format (for review or team discussion)

- List of structural problems (at least 3)
- Refactoring strategy and justification for selected patterns
- Overview of the improved architecture (e.g., how logging/config/business logic responsibilities are separated)
