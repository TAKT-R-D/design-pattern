# Refactoring Task

## Overview

This exercise addresses a structure where the management of inquiry ticket states is handled by a single method using conditional branches.  
You are to identify the design issues from the perspectives of extensibility, maintainability, and testability, and propose a viable refactoring plan.

## Initial Code

The following implementation defines a `handle()` method that transitions a support ticket through the following states: `open` → `in_progress` → `resolved` → `closed`.  
All state-dependent behaviors and transitions are hardcoded using `if` statements within the same method, making it difficult to accommodate future changes or new states.

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Question 1: What design problems exist in this code?

List and explain specific issues based on the following perspectives:

- **All state-specific logic is centralized in a single method**
- **Difficult to add new states or transition conditions**
- **Violates SRP (Single Responsibility Principle) and OCP (Open/Closed Principle)**
- **Hard to test or reuse individual transitions**

## Question 2: How can this structure be made more maintainable and flexible?

Formulate an improvement plan based on the following points:

- How can logic for each state be separated and encapsulated?
- What would the class design look like if each state were modeled as its own object?
- What design patterns would be effective, and why?

### Example: Design Pattern Candidates

| Pattern Name | Purpose and Effects                                                              |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `State`      | Encapsulates state-specific behavior in separate classes and handles transitions |
| `Strategy`   | Provides flexible selection of behavior (when transition control is external)    |
| `Command`    | Treats each operation as an object, enabling tracking of state changes and undo  |
| `Observer`   | Notifies external components when state changes, enabling reactive state updates |

## Optional Extensions

- If new states such as "on_hold" or "escalated" are introduced, how would the structure accommodate them?
- If state transitions depend on user permissions or action types, how would you incorporate such conditions into the design?

## Suggested Output Format (for review or study groups)

- List of at least three structural problems
- Refactoring strategy and rationale behind chosen patterns
- Design sketch or textual flow of the improved structure (e.g., class relationships or method delegation)
