# Single State Handling

## Description

### What does it look like?

- Object behavior varies by internal state, but **state and behavior are tightly coupled**
- State-specific behavior is managed using `if` or `switch` statements
- As states increase, the logic **bloats and becomes harder to read**

### Why is it a problem?

- Each new state requires modifying existing code (**violates the Open/Closed Principle**)
- Responsibilities are concentrated in a single class, leading to **low readability and difficult testing**
- Future expansions and state transition logic become complex and error-prone

## Bad Example of the Anti-pattern

<Tabs groupId="language">
  <TabItem value="ts" label="TypeScript">
    <CodeBlock language="ts">{tsCode}</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="php" label="PHP">
    <CodeBlock language="php">{phpCode}</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="python" label="Python">
    <CodeBlock language="python">{pyCode}</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Issues:

- State is managed as a plain string, and behavior is centralized in a single method
- Whenever a new state is added, `publish()` must be modified
- Mixing state and logic in one place makes the design **fragile and hard to extend**

## Refactoring by Pattern

### Design patterns that can address this

| Pattern    | Overview                                              | Main Refactoring Approach                     |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `State`    | Separate objects by state and delegate behavior       | Manage state explicitly using classes         |
| `Strategy` | Replace behavior externally                           | Let external context control state switching  |
| `Command`  | Encapsulate state-specific actions as command objects | Represent behavior as objects for flexibility |
