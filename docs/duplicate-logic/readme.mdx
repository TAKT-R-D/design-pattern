# Duplicated Logic

## Description

### What does it look like?

- Similar logic is **copy-pasted in multiple places**
- Slight variations are manually modified after duplicating a base implementation
- Although it may look readable, **maintainability and consistency are compromised**

### Why is it a problem?

- When changes are needed, **every copy must be found and updated**
- If even one is missed, it can **lead to bugs**
- Increases the effort for testing and code reviews, **reducing overall reliability**

## Bad Example of the Anti-pattern

<Tabs groupId="language">
  <TabItem value="ts" label="TypeScript">
    <CodeBlock language="ts">{tsCode}</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="php" label="PHP">
    <CodeBlock language="php">{phpCode}</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="python" label="Python">
    <CodeBlock language="python">{pyCode}</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Issues:

- All exporters repeat the same **start and finish logging**
- The only variation is the output logic, yet the full structure is rewritten every time
- Any change to logging or formatting must be **reflected across all exporters**

## Refactoring by Pattern

### Design patterns that can address this

| Pattern           | Overview                                                   | Main Refactoring Approach                            |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `Template Method` | Standardize flow and define only differences in subclasses | Centralize the “template” of processing              |
| `Strategy`        | Inject the varying behavior externally                     | Enable dynamic swapping of logic                     |
| `Decorator`       | Wrap and add or override functionality                     | Stack reusable enhancements around core behavior     |
| `Visitor`         | Separate logic from data structure                         | Externalize logic to support multiple output formats |
| `Prototype`       | Clone instances from a template                            | Replace manual rewriting with instance duplication   |
