# Refactoring Task

## Overview

This exercise focuses on a structure in which **common pre- and post-processing logic is repeatedly implemented** across multiple file upload classes.  
You are expected to identify the design problems in terms of maintainability, reusability, and extensibility, and propose a refactoring plan.

## Initial Code

The following implementation handles file uploads for images, videos, and audio, each in a separate class.  
All classes perform the same sequence of steps—"Start validation", "Upload", and "Print completion"—in a repeated manner.  
Consider how this duplication might affect future maintenance and what alternatives could be introduced.

  <TabItem value="python" label="Python">

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Question 1: What design issues can you identify in this code?

List specific problems using the following points as guidance:

- **Common logic is duplicated across all classes**
- **Adding or changing shared behavior requires edits in multiple locations**
- **Risk of inconsistency or oversight when making updates**
- **Violation of the Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**

## Question 2: How can the structure be improved for better maintainability and flexibility?

Discuss improvement strategies with consideration for the following:

- What techniques can be used to consolidate common logic?
- How can the core upload behavior be isolated as the only customizable part?
- Which design patterns are applicable, and what are their benefits and trade-offs?

### Example: Candidate Design Patterns

| Pattern Name      | Purpose and Effect                                                                        |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Template Method` | Consolidates shared logic in a base class, allowing customization of core steps           |
| `Strategy`        | Encapsulates variation in behavior as interchangeable strategy objects                    |
| `Decorator`       | Dynamically adds behavior to the upload process without modifying the core logic          |
| `Visitor`         | Externalizes operations for different file types to achieve a highly extensible structure |

## Optional Extensions

- If new file types (e.g., JSON, Markdown) need to be added, how can the structure minimize the impact of such changes?
- If a virus scanning step must be added before uploads, which pattern best accommodates this without breaking existing logic?

## Suggested Output Format (for review or team discussion)

- At least three identified structural issues
- Refactoring strategy and rationale for chosen pattern(s)
- Conceptual diagram or textual description of the improved design (e.g., inheritance or delegation model)
