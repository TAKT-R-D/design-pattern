# Refactoring Task

## Overview

This exercise focuses on identifying design issues caused by the "God Object" anti-pattern, where a single class accumulates multiple responsibilities.  
The goal is to analyze the problems and propose refactoring strategies using appropriate design patterns to improve the structure.

## Initial Code

The following code shows the implementation of a `PostManager` class that handles all logic related to blog posts.  
Analyze this code for structural problems and consider ways to improve it.

<Tabs groupId="language">
  <TabItem value="ts" label="TypeScript">
    <CodeBlock language="ts">{tsCode}</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="php" label="PHP">
    <CodeBlock language="php">{phpCode}</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="python" label="Python">
    <CodeBlock language="python">{pyCode}</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Question 1: What are the design issues in this code?

List concrete issues by considering the following perspectives:

- **Lack of responsibility separation** (Are multiple concerns mixed within a single class?)
- **Poor extensibility and maintainability** (Is the code prone to ripple effects when modified?)
- **Lack of reusability** (Are parts of the code difficult to reuse elsewhere?)
- **Low testability** (Can each functionality be tested in isolation?)

## Question 2: How would you refactor this class?

Discuss your ideas with the following elements in mind:

- Concerns that should be separated (e.g., posting logic, notification handling, logging)
- Benefits of splitting responsibilities into separate classes or services
- Design patterns applicable to each concern and their intended purpose/effect

### Example: Candidate Patterns

| Pattern     | Primary Purpose and Benefit                                                          |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `Facade`    | Consolidates post-confirmation logic into a single interface, simplifying the caller |
| `Strategy`  | Makes the notification method (e.g., Email / Slack) easily swappable                 |
| `State`     | Enables behavior to vary based on post state (e.g., draft / published)               |
| `Composite` | Structures posts so they can be handled as a group (e.g., batch publishing)          |
| `Iterator`  | Enables safe and abstracted iteration through post collections                       |

## Optional Extensions

For the following feature additions, consider what design strategies would be appropriate:

- Introduce state management for posts (e.g., "scheduled", "published")
- Allow notification channels (Slack, LINE, email) to be configurable externally
- Enable custom templates per post

## Suggested Output Format (for team review or study groups)

- Structural issues identified (at least 3 items)
- Refactoring strategy and justification
- Proposed design patterns and rationale for selection
- (Optional) Diagram of improved class structure
