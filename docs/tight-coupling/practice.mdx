# Refactoring Task

## Overview

This exercise addresses a design in which the `OrderService` directly creates and utilizes an `InventoryService` instance during order processing.  
You will examine this structure from the perspective of **dependency decoupling, abstraction, and injection**, and propose refactoring strategies.

## Initial Code

The following example shows an `OrderService` class that handles order placement and directly reduces inventory by creating an `InventoryService` instance.  
This tight coupling raises concerns around maintainability, reusability, and testability.

<Tabs groupId="language">
  <TabItem value="ts" label="TypeScript">
    <CodeBlock language="ts">{tsCode}</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="php" label="PHP">
    <CodeBlock language="php">{phpCode}</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="python" label="Python">
    <CodeBlock language="python">{pyCode}</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Question 1: What are the structural problems in this code?

Identify and explain the key design issues using the following points as a guide:

- **Tight dependency on implementation**, making mocking or substitution difficult
- **Low reusability**, resulting in poor decoupling and flexibility
- **Violations of DIP (Dependency Inversion Principle) and OCP (Open/Closed Principle)**
- **Blurred responsibility boundaries**, hindering testability and maintainability

## Question 2: How can this structure be refactored to improve flexibility and maintainability?

Provide a refactoring plan considering the following:

- How can the dependent class be **injected from the outside** instead of instantiated internally?
- How can we **reverse the direction of dependency** to achieve more modular design?
- How can we support multiple implementations (e.g., `MockInventoryService`, `RemoteInventoryAPI`)?

### Example: Candidate Design Patterns

| Pattern Name           | Purpose and Effect                                                                   |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `Observer`             | Decouples components via event notifications, reducing direct dependencies           |
| `Mediator`             | Centralizes coordination between services, avoiding direct inter-class references    |
| `Dependency Injection` | Allows injection of dependencies from outside, improving flexibility and testability |
| `Abstract Factory`     | Enables switching between object configurations by delegating creation logic         |

## Optional Extensions

- If `ShippingService` or `PaymentService` were added, how would you restructure the dependencies?
- If multiple implementations of `InventoryService` exist (e.g., local vs. remote API), how would you switch between them dynamically?

## Suggested Output Format (for review or team discussion)

- List of structural issues (at least three)
- Refactoring strategy and rationale for chosen pattern(s)
- Conceptual design of the improved structure (e.g., injection method or dependency diagram)
