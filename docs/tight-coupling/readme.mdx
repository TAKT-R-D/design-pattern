# Tight Coupling

## Description

### What does it look like?

- A class (e.g., `OrderService`) **directly instantiates or calls** another class (e.g., `EmailService`, `InventoryService`)
- Due to strong dependencies, **any change to a dependency immediately affects the caller**
- Difficult to substitute mocks or stubs during testing
- **Readability, flexibility, and testability suffer**

### Why is it a problem?

- Every addition or modification requires changes in the original class, resulting in **high maintenance cost**
- Leads to a state where “it works, so don’t touch it,” **accumulating technical debt**
- The class ends up with multiple responsibilities, resulting in **poor separation of concerns**

## Bad Example of the Anti-pattern

<Tabs groupId="language">
  <TabItem value="ts" label="TypeScript">
    <CodeBlock language="ts">{tsCode}</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="php" label="PHP">
    <CodeBlock language="php">{phpCode}</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="python" label="Python">
    <CodeBlock language="python">{pyCode}</CodeBlock>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Issues:

- `UserService` is tightly coupled to `Mailer`, and locked into its specific implementation
- Difficult to switch to another mail system (e.g., external API, mock service)
- If requirements change (e.g., logging mailer, switching to SMS), changes must be made to `UserService`
- Even if you want to share the `Mailer` logic, each instance is created separately, making it hard to centralize configuration

## Refactoring by Pattern

### Design patterns that can address this

| Pattern                     | Overview                                              | Main Refactoring Approach                    |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `Observer`                  | Delegate processing via event notification            | Use external registration for loose coupling |
| `Mediator`                  | A central coordinator mediates communication          | Reduce many-to-many dependencies to 1-to-1   |
| `Dependency Injection (DI)` | Inject dependencies from outside for easy replacement | Improves testability and extensibility       |
